      "question": "Is solar energy cheap or expensive?",
      "snippet": "Clearly, solar power is more cost-effective than “regular” or standard electricity. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), installing new solar panels is cheaper than a comparable investment in coal, natural gas or other fossil fuel options.Sep 10, 2019",
