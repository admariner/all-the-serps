      "question": "Why solar energy is costly?",
      "snippet": "While the cost to install solar systems is falling, the actual cost of generating power is decreasing as well. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), photovoltaic solar energy costs roughly $.10 per kilowatt hour. Producing the same amount of energy with fossil fuels ranges from $.05 to $.17.Aug 15, 2018",
